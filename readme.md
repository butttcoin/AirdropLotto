## Why Twitter and Telegram ?
We simply need to expand on our community, and although ButtCoin does not agree with some of the Twitter as well as Telegram policies, it is a necessary requirement to make the project grow within the crypto community. It is currently a standard, hopeffuly it will be changed in the future.

## Why an airdrop at all ?
This way, we can make sure that 0xBUTT token is properly distributed and our community growth established.

## How will airdrop be sent ?
The airdrop will be sent in batches of 100 addresses. As soon as the 100 addresses are filled, airdrop will be sent to 100 addresses in a queue. You can see the current queue in https://github.com/butttcoin/AirdropLotto/blob/master/addresses.csv .
Before sending the tokens, the random amount of tokens will be generated.

## When does the airdrop end ?
This airdrop will end as soon as we feel that our community requirements are met, and that we have enough people on a Telegram group.

## I am already on a Telegram, can I still apply for an airdrop ?
Yes, if and only if, you hold 100 0xBUTTs or less on your account.

## What is a lottery and how does it work ?
To make things more interesting, the minimum amount of the tokens that will be sent is 100. The maximum is 500. A source-code will be released, and this page updated with a link.

## You said 100 0xBUTTs, but I got 98... how come ?
This is because we are burning 1% and 1% goes to a previous sender of a token.

## 1% is sent to your account... why ?
Simply because the owner was the last one to make a transfer, so 1% goes back to a previous sender. Feel free to investigate ButtCoin's test-cases to confirm how it works. Don't worry, you will also get a 1% from someone else's transaction, whenever you move the tokens.

## How do I become a 0xBUTT millionaire ?
Upon the completion of an airdrop, we will award random accounts the standard lottery winning distribution. 

FIRST PRICE: 1,000,000.0 0xBUTTs

SECOND PRICE: 100,000.0 0xBUTTs

THIRD PRICE: 10,000.0 0xBUTTs

FOURTH PRICE: 1000.0 0xBUTTS

FIFTH PRICE: 100.0 0xBUTTS

The burning/transfer reduction will apply.
