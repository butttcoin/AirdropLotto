# THIS AIRDROP HAS ENDED!

Thank you for participating in the Lottery Airdrop. The lucky winners will be announced soon.

Please give us some time for all tokens to be distributed. 
There are about 10 batches of 100 addresses, and to see which ones have been processed and/or are processing, go to:
https://etherscan.io/address/0x60af68d5fe8a50310adc90d5510597229cb1167b
The submitted batches are marked as "DONE" in a CSV file:
https://github.com/butttcoin/AirdropLotto/blob/master/addresses.csv
Otherwise, we are waiting for ETH network to complete transactions while keeping all information in order, and without mistakes.

There is a high chance that some of you did not get the tokens in your wallets due to a mistake in posting your re-tweet address. 
If that is the case, you will have to find your address on this list: https://github.com/butttcoin/AirdropLotto/blob/master/addresses.csv
If not on the list, then please send me a private message. Do include your twitter username and your ETH address, and DO NOT remove your retweet. 
Only those retweets that happened before the end of the airdrop will be rewarded.
In case you missed this airdrop, for whatever reason, there will be more in the future and it will be announced. 

Please follow 0xBUTT on Twitter (@0xbutt) or join this Telegram group. 

Thank you kindly for participating and supporting this project. It was truly a fun airdrop.

If you notice that your message is gone/deleted, it means that it has been noted for the next airdrop batch. 
To verify, please see: https://github.com/butttcoin/AirdropLotto/blob/master/addresses.csv

## Where is my Telegram post, why was it deleted?
Don't worry, it means that you were added, and we are keeping things clean.  Please see: https://github.com/butttcoin/AirdropLotto/blob/master/addresses.csv

## Why Twitter and Telegram ?
We simply need to expand on our community, and although ButtCoin does not agree with some of the Twitter as well as Telegram policies, it is a necessary requirement to make the project grow within the crypto community. It is currently a standard, and hopeffuly it will be changed in the future adding more privacy to people's choices and options.

## Why an airdrop at all ?
This way, we can make sure that 0xBUTT token is properly distributed and our community growth established.

## How will airdrop be sent ?
The airdrop will be sent in batches of 100 addresses. As soon as the 100 addresses are filled, airdrop will be sent to 100 addresses in a queue. You can see the current queue in https://github.com/butttcoin/AirdropLotto/blob/master/addresses.csv .
Before sending the tokens, the random amount of tokens will be generated.

## When does the airdrop end ?
This airdrop will end as soon as we feel that our community requirements are met, and that we have enough people on a Telegram group.

## I am already on a Telegram, can I still apply for an airdrop ?
Yes, if and only if, you hold 100 0xBUTTs or less on your account. You will also have to re-tweet.

## What is a lottery and how does it work ?
To make things more interesting, the minimum amount of the tokens that will be sent is 100. The maximum is 500. A source-code is very simple and distribution is random: https://github.com/butttcoin/AirdropLotto/blob/master/Lottery.java

## You said 100 0xBUTTs, but I got 98... how come ?
This is because we are burning 1% and 1% goes to a previous sender of a token.

## 1% is sent to your account... why ?
Simply because the owner was the last one to make a transfer, so 1% goes back to a previous sender. Feel free to investigate ButtCoin's test-cases to confirm how it works. Don't worry, you will also get a 1% from someone else's transaction, whenever you move the tokens.

## How do I become a 0xBUTT millionaire ?
Upon the completion of an airdrop, we will award random accounts the standard lottery winning distribution.
